# cloudflare_real-ip - Docker mod for SWAG

This mod adds a startup scipt that gets the IP's from Cloudflares edge servers, and formats them in a format Nginx can use with `set_real_ip_from`.

It reads this [list for IPv4](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips-v4), and this [list for IPV6](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips-v6).

In SWAG docker arguments, set an environment variable `DOCKER_MODS=linuxserver/mods:swag-cloudflare-real-ip`

If adding multiple mods, enter them in an array separated by `|`, such as `DOCKER_MODS=linuxserver/mods:swag-cloudflare-real-ip|linuxserver/mods:swag-f2bdiscord`

## Mod usage instructions

The file gets placed in your persistant data, at `/config/nginx/cf_real-ip.conf`

To enable nginx to read the ips from this file, you need the following in your nginx.conf (http section):

```nginx
real_ip_header X-Forwarded-For;
real_ip_recursive on;
include /config/nginx/cf_real-ip.conf;
```

~~I also recommend including your docker-network as a valid ip `set_real_ip_from 172.17.0.0/16;` in the snippet above.~~

This mod now also *tries* to set the real ip from the interfaces in the container.

## Cloudflare tunnels

In case you use cloudflare tunnels, real IP might be reported in containers as 127.0.0.1
In this case, please add below to HTTP section of nginx.conf.

From:


```nginx
real_ip_header X-Forwarded-For;
real_ip_recursive on;
include /config/nginx/cf_real-ip.conf;
```

to:

```nginx
real_ip_header X-Forwarded-For;
real_ip_recursive on;
include /config/nginx/cf_real-ip.conf;
set_real_ip_from 127.0.0.1;
```
